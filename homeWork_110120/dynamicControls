Dynamic Controls

----------------
Summary:
Observe and learn what's gonna happen as you changed the elements asynchronously. Test and observe as you click the elements.

Setup:
https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_controls

Steps:
1. Click the checkbox.
2. Click the remove button.
3. Click the add button
3. Click Enable button.
4. Type any string within the place field.
5. Click Disable.

Result:
The checkbox when checked is working and once I clicked the remove button a loading element at the button shows up. The same at the button with Enable/disable where in as I click Enable a loading element shows up then allows a user to type in the string. It is a great representation of an asynchronous change where in every event made by the user, within the back an asynchronous change is happening.
