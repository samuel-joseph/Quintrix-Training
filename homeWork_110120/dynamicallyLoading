Result:
	In the example 1 page as I check the inspect, there already exist an element which is hidden to the page it has a class called "Finish" property of hidden with "Hello World" as title but as soon as you clicked start from example 1 it changed its property hidden to visible making it visible to the page and the element with "Start" title disappears to the page.
